*** THE INDEX.HTML FILE IN THIS FOLDER IS ONLY FOR BACKEND USE ***

This file is what the back-end guys will use to test API functions.

*** THIS IS NOT THE CLIENT PUBLIC FOLDER ***

If you are editing index.html and are trying to wrtie REACT code you are in the wrong spot. The REACT source code is in the client folder.
